Vanilla minecraft laucnher(VLauncher)

"VLaucnher" or "VanillaLauncher" This is my minecraft launcher.



Multiplayer may not work on some versions (sorry, I can't fix it)
If your launcher closes when you install the version, try reopening the launcher and reopening it.

This launcher was not created for commercial purposes.
The author created it for personal use in order to use it quickly and be sure that there are no viruses in it.
